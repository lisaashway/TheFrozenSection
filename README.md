This repository contains the contents of a dashboard highlighting access to grocery stores in Atlanta (and the rest of Georgia) based on Income & Education. The dashboard can hopefully provide insights into what types of grocery stores are located in each zipcode of Atlanta. It can also be used to address food deserts in Georgia, as well as understand the demographic requirements that big chain grocery stores use to find new locations.

This project utilizes leaflet, d3, JavaScript plotly, google places api, and Bootstrap
